Quick update on the event bugs:
- I fixed the bug where events would be incorrectly marked as read-only.
- We expose RRULEs as valid JSON now. 

We're currently testing the fixes, they should ship early next week.

Concerning timezones, an event should always be associated with a timezone. Having a NULL value instead is a bug on our end. I will be working on fixing this on Monday and will let you know when it's fixed.

Thanks for your detailed bug reports,</span></font></pre>
