<strong>So this is an interesting test case. The email below looks like it failed quoted text detection. However, you can see that there is some plain text (the signature) at the bottom of the email after the blockquote. Unfortunately this looks arguably identical to someone who inline-replied to a message after a piece of quoted text. As such there's not a lot we can do about this until we can come up with an efficient way to inspect the bodies of previous messages. This is likely something that will have to happen server-side.</strong>
